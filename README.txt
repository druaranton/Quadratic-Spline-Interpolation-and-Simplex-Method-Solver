In this exercise, I learned how to create a simple user interface.
I also learned how to use and explore R-shiny. 
Moreover, I learned how to use other libraries such as rhandsontable, shinyalert, and shinythemes.
Though not used in my final submission, I also learned how to use the shinyMatrix library.

Thank you po sir hehe
